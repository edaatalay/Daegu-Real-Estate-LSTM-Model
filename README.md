This project is graduation project for Istanbul Technical University, Mathematics Engineering major. This is the first-semester work of the project.

In the project, feed forward neural networks, which are subject of deep learning was thoroughly examined during first semester. The mathematical relationships and the parameters affecting the result were learned, the related equations were examined. In addition, regression problem sample was studied to reinforce what was learned throughout this period. Deep learning functions and their arguments on Python were examined and practiced on the sample data set.

The sample data set contains house sale prices in the city of Daegu, Republic of Korea and taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gunhee/koreahousedata).
